Problem Statement    [ Mail @ Mridu.Alagh@go-mmt.com ]

Time Limit 60 minutes

Create a log query application. The application should read a log file which has application log data (as key and value) in JSON format.
The log file is shared with this problem

    eg : {"pfm":"DESKTOP", "level":"INFO", "step" : "SEARCH", "timestamp":"2020-11-18 13:24:11.039+0530"}
         {"pfm":"PWA", "level":"DEBUG", "step" : "REVIEW", "timestamp":"2020-11-18 13:24:11.039+0530"}

The application should be able to answer below queries
queries
    1. find total occurrence of a value
    2. find occurrence of value1 and value2
    3. find occurrence of value1 or value2

    Bonus
    * above queries in a specified time range

Please have a Main class as entry point to run the code and set the query value

Expectations

    Make sure that you have a working and demonstrable code
    Make sure that the code is functionally correct
    Code should be modular and readable
    Separation of concern should be addressed
    Please do not write everything in a single file
    Code should easily accommodate new requirements and minimal changes
    There should be a main method from where the code could be easily testable
    [Optional] Write unit tests, if possible
    No need to create a GUI
